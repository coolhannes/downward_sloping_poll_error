### Description
This is some simple analysis to show the relationship between the partisanship of a state and error in the polling margin. Because the lines generally slope _down_ that means that polls tend to over-estimate the Democrats in Red states, and the same of GOP in Blue states. The intercept of a 0pp mean error is generally around a tied (D+0/R+0) state.
